# Summit2018
Herein is a lab g uide for the Summit 2018 Integrated Management Lab, and Satellite + Insights Workshop. Use the same manual for both courses. The Workshop is simply a smaller version of the lab (without CloudForms). The documentation and workflows are the same, users just won't be able to complete the CloudForms portions if attempting the workshop deployment.

Use the provided auto_lab key to login to the jumpbox. Download this key then use it as an identity to connect to the jumpbox/workstation.

The labs work fine on deployment and if you follow all documentation you should be able to complete within 2 hours (with working knowledge).
